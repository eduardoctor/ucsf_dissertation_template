  abstractnote = {BackgroundGliomas are the most common primary brain tumors in adults. We sought to understand the roles of endogenous transposable elements in these malignancies by identifying evidence of somatic retrotransposition in glioblastomas (GBM). We performed transposon insertion profiling of the active subfamily of Long INterspersed Element-1 (LINE-1) elements by deep sequencing (TIPseq) on genomic DNA of low passage oncosphere cell lines derived from 7 primary GBM biopsies, 3 secondary GBM tissue samples, and matched normal intravenous blood samples from the same individuals.ResultsWe found and PCR validated one somatically acquired tumor-specific insertion in a case of secondary GBM. No LINE-1 insertions present in primary GBM oncosphere cultures were missing from corresponding blood samples. However, several copies of the element (11) were found in genomic DNA from blood and not in the oncosphere cultures. SNP 6.0 microarray analysis revealed deletions or loss of heterozygosity in the tumor genomes over the intervals corresponding to these LINE-1 insertions.ConclusionsThese findings indicate that LINE-1 retrotransposon can act as an infrequent insertional mutagen in secondary GBM, but that retrotransposition is uncommon in these central nervous system tumors as compared to other neoplasias.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13100-016-0077-5) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.},

These new findings have major implications for understanding the neuroplasticity of the brain, which could hypothetically have a role in behavior and cognition, and contribute to vulnerability to disease. As active TEs could induce genetic diversity and mutagenesis, their influences on human brain development and diseases are of great interest. In this review, we will focus on the active TEs in the human genome and discuss in detail their impacts on human brain development.

In addition to its function in tumour suppression, p53 also plays a major role in the response of malignant as well as nontransformed cells to many anticancer therapeutics, particularly those that cause DNA damage. P53 forms a homotetrameric transcription factor that is reported to directly regulate ~500 target genes, thereby controlling a broad range of cellular processes, including cell cycle arrest, cell senescence, DNA repair, metabolic adaptation and cell death. For a long time, induction of apoptotic death in nascent neoplastic cells was regarded as the principal mechanism by which p53 prevents tumour development. This concept has, however, recently been challenged by the findings that in striking contrast to Trp53-deficient mice, gene-targeted mice that lack the critical effectors of p53-induced apoptosis do not develop tumours spontaneously. Remarkably, even mice lacking all mediators critical for p53-induced apoptosis, G1/S boundary cell cycle arrest and cell senescence do not develop any tumours spontaneously. In this review we discuss current understanding of the mechanisms by which p53 induces cell death and how this affects p53-mediated tumour suppression and the response of malignant cells to anticancer therapy.},

Many studies have revealed that TEs are not simply “junk” DNA, but rather, they play various roles in processes, including genome evolution, gene expression regulation, genetic instability, and cancer disposition. The effects of TE insertion in the genome varies from negligible to disease conditions. For the past two decades, many studies have shown that TEs are the causative factors of various genetic disorders and cancer. TEs are a subject of interest worldwide, not only in terms of their clinical aspects but also in basic research, such as evolutionary tracking. Although active TEs contribute to genetic instability and disease states, non-long terminal repeat transposons are well studied, and their roles in these processes have been confirmed. In this review, we will give an overview of the importance of TEs in studying genome evolution and genetic instability, and we suggest that further in-depth studies on the mechanisms related to these phenomena will be useful for both evolutionary tracking and clinical diagnostics.},

  abstractnote = {Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is a malignant tumor of the central nervous system (CNS). The poor prognosis of GBM due to resistance to therapy has been associated with high chromosomal instability (CIN). Replication stress is a major cause of CIN that manifests as chromosome rearrangements, fragility, and breaks, including those cytologically expressed within specific chromosome regions named common fragile sites (CFSs). In this work, we characterized the expression of human CFSs in the glioblastoma U-251 MG cell line upon treatment with the inhibitor of DNA polymerase alpha aphidicolin (APH). We observed 52 gaps/breaks located within previously characterized CFSs. We found 17 to be CFSs in GBM cells upon treatment with APH, showing a frequency equal to at least 1% of the total gaps/breaks. We report that two CFSs localized to regions FRA2E (2p13/p12) and FRA2F (2q22) were only found in U-251 MG cells, but not lymphocytes or fibroblasts, after APH treatment. Notably, these glioblastoma-specific CFSs had a relatively high expression compared to the other CFSs with breakage frequency between ∼7 and 9%. Presence of long genes, incomplete replication, and delayed DNA synthesis during mitosis (MiDAS) after APH treatment suggest that an impaired replication process may contribute to this loci-specific fragility in U-251 MG cells. Altogether, our work offers a characterization of common fragile site expression in glioblastoma U-251 MG cells that may be further exploited for cytogenetic and clinical studies to advance our understanding of this incurable cancer.},

One class of these elements, the human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs), is comprised of remnants of ancient exogenous retroviruses that have gained access to the germ line. After integration, most proviruses have been the subject of numerous amplifications and have suffered extensive deletions and mutations. Nevertheless, HERV-derived transcripts and proteins have been detected in healthy and diseased human tissues, and HERV-K, the youngest, most conserved family, is able to form virus-like particles. Although it is generally accepted that the integration of retroelements can cause significant harm by disrupting or disregulating essential genes, the role of HERV expression in the etiology of malignancies and autoimmune and neurologic diseases remains controversial. In recent years, striking evidence has accumulated indicating that some proviral sequences and HERV proteins might even serve the needs of the host and are therefore under positive selection. The remarkable progress in the analysis of host genomes has brought to light the significant impact of HERVs and other retroelements on genetic variation, genome evolution, and gene regulation.},

The predominant tissue of LINE-1 expression has been considered to be the germ line. We show that both full-length and processed L1 transcripts are widespread in human somatic tissues and transformed cells, with significant variation in both L1 expression and L1 mRNA processing. This is the first demonstration that RNA processing is a major regulator of L1 activity. Many tissues also produce translatable spliced transcript (SpORF2). An Alu retrotransposition assay, COMET assays and 53BP1 foci staining show that the SpORF2 product can support functional ORF2 protein expression and can induce DNA damage in normal cells. Tests of the senescence-associated β-galactosidase expression suggest that expression of exogenous full-length L1, or the SpORF2 mRNA alone in human fibroblasts and adult stem cells triggers a senescence-like phenotype, which is one of the reported responses to DNA damage. In contrast to previous assumptions that L1 expression is germ line specific, the increased spectrum of tissues exposed to L1-associated damage suggests a role for L1 as an endogenous mutagen in somatic tissues. These findings have potential consequences for the whole organism in the form of cancer and mammalian aging.},

Only the HERV-K(HML2) family has been active since the divergence of humans and chimpanzees; it contains many members that are human specific, as well as several that are insertionally polymorphic (an inserted element present only in some human individuals). Here we perform a genomewide survey of insertional polymorphism levels in this family by using the published human genome sequence and a diverse sample of 19 humans. We find that there are 113 human-specific HERV-K(HML2) elements in the human genome sequence, 8 of which are insertionally polymorphic (11 if we extrapolate to those within regions of the genome that were not suitable for amplification). The average rate of accumulation since the divergence with chimpanzees is thus approximately 3.8 × 10−4 per haploid genome per generation. Furthermore, we find that the number of polymorphic elements is not significantly different from that predicted by a standard population genetic model that assumes constant activity of the family until the present. This suggests to us that the HERV-K(HML2) family may be active in present-day humans. Active (replication-competent) elements are likely to have inserted very recently and to be present at low allele frequencies, and they may be causing disease in the individuals carrying them. This view of the family from a population perspective rather than a genome perspective will inform the current debate about a possible role of HERV-K(HML2) in human disease.},

Consequently, the human genome currently harbors 1.1 million Alu copies. Some of these copies remain actively mobile and continue to produce both genetic variation and diseases by “jumping” to new genomic locations. However, it is unclear how many active Alu copies exist in the human genome and which Alu subfamilies harbor such copies. Here, we present a comprehensive functional analysis of Alu copies across the human genome. We cloned Alu copies from a variety of genomic locations and tested these copies in a plasmid-based mobilization assay. We show that functionally intact core Alu elements are highly abundant and far outnumber all other active transposons in humans. A range of Alu lineages were found to harbor such copies, including all modern AluY subfamilies and most AluS subfamilies. We also identified two major determinants of Alu activity: (1) The primary sequence of a given Alu copy, and (2) the ability of the encoded RNA to interact with SRP9/14 to form RNA/protein (RNP) complexes. We conclude that Alu elements pose the largest transposon-based mutagenic threat to the human genome. On the basis of our data, we have begun to identify Alu copies that are likely to produce genetic variation and diseases in humans.},

Protein binding partners of the functionally related murine RNA BC1 as well as a scrambled BC200 RNA were also assessed in both human and mouse cell lines. Stringent validation of proteins identified by mass spectrometry confirmed 14 of 84 protein binding partners and excluded eight proteins that did not appreciably bind BC200 in reverse experiments. Gene ontology analyses revealed general roles in RNA metabolic processes, RNA processing and splicing. Protein/RNA interaction sites were mapped with a series of RNA truncations revealing three distinct modes of interaction involving either the 5′ Alu-domain, 3′ A-rich or 3′ C-rich regions. Due to their high enrichment values in reverse experiments, CSDE1 and STRAP were further analyzed demonstrating a direct interaction between CSDE1 and BC200 and indirect binding of STRAP to BC200 via heterodimerization with CSDE1. Knock-down studies identified a reciprocal regulatory relationship between CSDE1 and BC200 and immunofluorescence analysis of BC200 knock-down cells demonstrated a dramatic reorganization of CSDE1 into distinct nuclear foci.},

Overall, the average survival of patients was 9 months. Patients tended to live longer if they were younger, had surgery, if they had further treatment after surgery (chemo- or radio-therapy), or if they had a tumour marker called MGMT promotor methylation.AbstractBackground: IDH-wildtype glioblastoma is the most common malignant primary brain tumour in adults. As there is limited information on prognostic factors outside of clinical trials; thus, we conducted a retrospective study to characterise the glioblastoma population at our centre. Methods: Demographic, tumour molecular profiles, treatment, and survival data were collated for patients diagnosed with glioblastoma at our centre between July 2011 and December 2015. We used multivariate proportional hazard model associations with survival. Results: 490 patients were included; 60% had debulking surgery and 40% biopsy only. Subsequently, 56% had standard chemoradiotherapy, 25% had non-standard chemo/radio-therapy, and 19% had no further treatment. Overall survival was 9.2 months. In the multivariate analysis, longer survival was associated with debulking surgery vs. biopsy alone (14.9 vs. 8 months) (HR 0.54 [95% CI 0.41–0.70]), subsequent treatment after diagnosis (HR 0.12 [0.08–0.16]) (standard chemoradiotherapy [16.9 months] vs. non-standard regimens [9.2 months] vs. none [2.0 months]), tumour MGMT promotor methylation (HR 0.71 [0.58–0.87]), and younger age (hazard ratio vs. age < 50: 1.70 [1.26–2.30] for ages 50–59; 3.53 [2.65–4.70] for ages 60–69; 4.82 [3.54–6.56] for ages 70+). Conclusions: The median survival for patients with glioblastoma is less than a year. Younger age, debulking surgery, treatment with chemoradiotherapy, and MGMT promotor methylation are independently associated with longer survival.},

Only retrotransposons are active as undomesticated mobile DNAs in humans.Ongoing retrotransposition in humans is attributed to long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1; also known as L1). Its activity creates genomic structural variants in human populations and alterations in cancer genomes. Endogenous retroviruses persist as promoter and protein-coding sequences.LINE-1 encodes open reading frame 1p (ORF1p) and ORF2p proteins. ORF1p is an RNA binding protein widely expressed in human malignancies. ORF2p encodes endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities essential for retrotransposition.LINE-1 activity generates new copies of itself, and also other sequences, including Alu and short interspersed element (SINE)–variable number tandem repeat (VNTR)–Alu (SVA) retrotransposons, pseudogene copies of messenger transcripts and U6 ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs).In cancer, source LINE-1 elements escape genomic DNA methylation and transcriptional repression to contribute new LINE-1 insertions. Different source elements may be active over different phases of the evolution of a cancer.Somatically acquired LINE-1 insertions can cause driver mutations, particularly in gastrointestinal tract tumours, which support high levels of retrotransposition. Distinguishing contributing mutations from inert passenger mutations is an important challenge for the field.},

Epigenomic studies profiling immune cells have generated detailed genome-wide maps of regulatory elements that will be key to deciphering the regulatory networks underlying cellular immune responses and autoimmune disorders. Unbiased analyses of these genomic maps have uncovered endogenous retroviruses as an unexpected ally in the regulation of human immune systems. Despite their parasitic origins, studies are finding an increasing number of examples of retroviral sequences having been co-opted for beneficial immune function and regulation by the host cell. Here we review how endogenous retroviruses have given rise to numerous regulatory elements that shape the epigenetic landscape of host immune responses. We will discuss the implications of these elements on the function, dysfunction, and evolution of innate immunity.},

  abstractnote = {Although gross insertions (>20 bp) comprise <1% of disease-causing mutations, they nevertheless represent an important category of pathological lesion. In an attempt to study these insertions in a systematic way, 158 gross insertions ranging in size between 21 bp and ∼10 kb were identified using the Human Gene Mutation Database (www.hgmd.org). A careful meta-analytical study revealed extensive diversity in terms of the nature of the inserted DNA sequence and has provided new insights into the underlying mutational mechanisms. Some 70% of gross insertions were found to represent sequence duplications of different types (tandem, partial tandem, or complex). Although most of the tandem duplications were explicable by simple replication slippage, the three complex duplications appear to result from multiple slippage events. Some 11% of gross insertions were attributable to nonpolyglutamine repeat expansions (including octapeptide repeat expansions in the prion protein gene [PRNP] and polyalanine tract expansions) and evidence is presented to support the contention that these mutations are also caused by replication slippage rather than by unequal crossing over. Some 17% of gross insertions, all ≥276 bp in length, were found to be due to LINE-1 (L1) retrotransposition involving different types of element (L1 trans-driven Alu, L1 direct, and L1 trans-driven SVA). A second example of pathological mitochondrial-nuclear sequence transfer was identified in the USH1C gene but appears to arise via a novel mechanism, trans-replication slippage. Finally, evidence for another novel mechanism of human genetic disease, involving the possible capture of DNA oligonucleotides, is presented in the context of a 26-bp insertion into the ERCC6 gene.

  abstractnote = {Diverse long interspersed element-1 (LINE-1 or L1)-dependent mutational mechanisms have been extensively studied with respect to L1 and Alu elements engineered for retrotransposition in cultured cells and/or in genome-wide analyses. To what extent the in vitro studies can be held to accurately reflect in vivo events in the human genome, however, remains to be clarified. We have attempted to address this question by means of a systematic analysis of recent L1-mediated retrotranspositional events that have caused human genetic disease, with a view to providing a more complete picture of how L1-mediated retrotransposition impacts upon the architecture of the human genome. A total of 48 such mutations were identified, including those described as L1-mediated retrotransposons, as well as insertions reported to contain a poly(A) tail: 26 were L1 trans-driven Alu insertions, 15 were direct L1 insertions, four were L1 trans-driven SVA insertions, and three were associated with simple poly(A) insertions. The systematic study of these lesions, when combined with previous in vitro and genome-wide analyses, has strengthened several important conclusions regarding L1-mediated retrotransposition in humans: (a) approximately 25% of L1 insertions are associated with the 3’ transduction of adjacent genomic sequences, (b) approximately 25% of the new L1 inserts are full-length, (c) poly(A) tail length correlates inversely with the age of the element, and (d) the length of target site duplication in vivo is rarely longer than 20 bp. Our analysis also suggests that some 10% of L1-mediated retrotranspositional events are associated with significant genomic deletions in humans. Finally, the identification of independent retrotranspositional events that have integrated at the same genomic locations provides new insight into the L1-mediated insertional process in humans.},

  abstractnote = {Features of the cancer epigenome distinguish cancers from their respective cell of origin and establish therapeutic vulnerabilities that can be exploited through pharmacologic inhibition of DNA- or histone-modifying enzymes. Epigenetic therapies converge with cancer immunotherapies through “viral mimicry,” a cellular state of active antiviral response triggered by endogenous nucleic acids often derived from aberrantly transcribed endogenous retrotransposons. This review describes the initial characterization and expansion of viral mimicry–inducing approaches as well as features that “prime” cancers for viral mimicry induction. Increased understanding of viral mimicry in therapeutic contexts suggests potential physiologic roles in cellular homeostasis.Recent literature establishes elevated cytosolic double strand RNA (dsRNA) levels as a cancer-specific therapeutic vulnerability that can be elevated by viral mimicry–inducing therapies beyond tolerable thresholds to induce antiviral signaling and increase dependence on dsRNA stress responses mediated by ADAR1. Improved understanding of viral mimicry signaling and tolerance mechanisms reveals synergistic treatment combinations with epigenetic therapies that include inhibition of BCL2, ADAR1, and immune checkpoint blockade. Further characterization of viral mimicry tolerance may identify contexts that maximize efficacy of conventional cancer therapies.},

BC200 RNA is not normally expressed in non-neuronal somatic cells; it has been shown, however, to be expressed in germ cells and in cultured immortal cell lines of various non-neural origins. In order to investigate whether the neuron-specific expression of BC200 RNA is also deregulated during tumourigenesis in non-neural human tissues, 80 different tumour specimens, representing 19 different tumour types, were screened for the presence of the RNA. BC200 RNA was expressed in carcinomas of the breast, cervix, oesophagus, lung, ovary, parotid, and tongue, but not in corresponding normal tissues. BC200 RNA was not detectable in bladder, colon, kidney, or liver carcinoma tissues examined in this study. These results demonstrate that BC200 expression is deregulated under certain neoplastic conditions. The expression of BC200 RNA in non-neural tumours may indicate a functional interrelationship with induction and/or progression of such tumours. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

In recent years, the introduction of whole-genome and whole-transcriptome approaches, as well as single-cell resolution techniques, provided a breakthrough that uncovered TE involvement in host gene expression regulation underlying multiple normal and pathological processes. Of particular interest is increased TE activity in neuronal tissue, and specifically in the hippocampus, that was repeatedly demonstrated in multiple experiments. On the other hand, numerous neuropathologies are associated with TE dysregulation. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of literature about the role of TEs in neurons published over the last three decades. The first chapter of the present review describes known mechanisms of TE interaction with host genomes in general, with the focus on mammalian and human TEs; the second chapter provides examples of TE exaptation in normal neuronal tissue, including TE involvement in neuronal differentiation and plasticity; and the last chapter lists TE-related neuropathologies. We sought to provide specific molecular mechanisms of TE involvement in neuron-specific processes whenever possible; however, in many cases, only phenomenological reports were available. This underscores the importance of further studies in this area.},

In ovarian cancer (OC), DNMTis trigger cytosolic sensing of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) causing a Type I Interferon response and apoptosis. Knocking down dsRNA sensors TLR3 and MAVS reduces this response twofold, and blocking interferon beta or its receptor abrogates it. Upregulation of hypermethylated endogenous retrovirus (ERV) genes accompanies the response and ERV overexpression activates the response. Basal levels of ERV and viral defense gene expression significantly correlate in primary OC and the latter signature separates primary samples for multiple tumor types from The Cancer Genome Atlas into low versus high expression groups. In melanoma patients treated with an immune checkpoint therapy, high viral defense signature expression in tumors significantly associates with durable clinical response and DNMTi treatment sensitizes to anti-CTLA4 therapy in a pre-clinical melanoma model.},

A dose- and time-dependent increase in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) gene expression with elevated prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production was identified in TPA- but not in 4α-TPA (a respective inactive compound)-treated U87 cells TPA-induced migration/invasion was significantly blocked by adding the COX-2-specific inhibitor, NS398, through a reduction in PGE2 production. Data from the pharmacological studies using specific chemical inhibitors showed that activation of protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) was involved in TPA-induced migration/invasion, COX-2 protein expression, and MMP-9 activation. Stimulation of intracellular peroxide production by TPA was detected by a DCHF-DA assay, and the addition of superoxide dismutase (SOD) or tempol significantly inhibited TPA-induced migration/invasion and COX-2 protein expression accompanied by a decrease in peroxide production. An increase in NADPH oxidase activity by TPA was examined, and TPA-induced migration/invasion was blocked by adding DPI, an NADPH oxidase inhibitor. Additionally, the natural flavonoids quercetin (QE), baicalein (BE), and myricetin (ME) effectively blocked TPA-induced migration/invasion while simultaneously inhibiting COX-2/PGE2 production, MMP-9 enzyme activity, and peroxide production in U87 cells. The contribution of ROS production to the migration/invasion of U87 glioblastoma cells via ERK-activated COX-2/PGE2 and MMP-9 induction was first investigated here, and agents such as QE, BE, and ME with the ability to block these events possess the potential to be developed for use against migration/invasion by glioblastomas.},

Whereas existing methods are mostly designed for short-read data, xTea can be applied to both short-read and long-read data.

With long-read data, we created a catalogue of polymorphic insertions with full assembly and annotation of insertional sequences for various types of retroelements, including pseudogenes and endogenous retroviruses. Notably, we find that individual genomes have an average of nine groups of full-length L1s in centromeres, suggesting that centromeres and other highly repetitive regions such as telomeres are a significant yet unexplored source of active L1s. xTea is available at https://github.com/parklab/xTea., Identification of transposable element (TE) insertions from whole genome sequencing data remains challenging.

HSCs that lack MDA5 exhibit an impaired inflammatory response after chemotherapy and retain their quiescence, with consequent better long-term repopulation capacity. We show that the overexpression of ERV and LINE superfamily TE copies in wild-type HSCs, but not in Mda5−/− HSCs, results in their cycling. By contrast, after knockdown of LINE1 family copies, HSCs retain their quiescence.

However, molecular agents targeting EGFR have demonstrated minimal efficacy in clinical trials, suggesting the existence of GBM resistance mechanisms. GBM cells with stem-like properties (CSCs) are highly efficient at tumor initiation and exhibit therapeutic resistance. In this study, GBMCSC lines showed sphere-forming and tumor initiation capacity after EGF withdrawal from cell culture media, compared with normal neural stem cells that rapidly perished after EGF withdrawal. Compensatory activation of related ERBB family receptors (ERBB2 and ERBB3) was observed in GBM CSCs deprived of EGFR signal (EGF deprivation or cetuximab inhibition), suggesting an intrinsic GBM resistance mechanism for EGFR-targeted therapy. Dual inhibition of EGFR and ERBB2 with lapatinib significantly reduced GBM proliferation in colony formation assays compared to cetuximab-mediated EGFR-specific inhibition. Phosphorylation of downstream ERBB signaling components (AKT, ERK1/2) and GBM CSC proliferation were inhibited by lapatinib. Collectively, these findings show that GBM therapeutic resistance to EGFR inhibitors may be explained by compensatory activation of EGFR-related family members (ERBB2, ERBB3) enabling GBM CSC proliferation, and therefore simultaneous blockade of multiple ERBB family members may be required for more efficacious GBM therapy.},

We previously demonstrated that engineered human L1s can retrotranspose in adult rat hippocampus progenitor cells (NPCs) in vitro and in the mouse brain in vivo. Here, we demonstrate that NPCs isolated from human fetal brain and NPCs derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) support the retrotransposition of engineered human L1s in vitro. Furthermore, we developed a quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction that detected an increase in the copy number of endogenous L1s in the hippocampus and in several regions of adult human brains when compared to the copy number of endogenous L1s in heart or liver genomic DNAs from the same donor. These data suggest that de novo L1 retrotransposition events may occur in the human brain and, in principle, have the potential to contribute to individual somatic mosaicism.},

A relationship between global hypomethylation and genomic instability has been shown, however, there is little evidence to suggest active role for hypomethylation-mediated reactivation of retroelements in human cancer. In our study, we examined by Pyrosequencing the methylation levels of LINE-1 and Alu sequences in 48 primary nonsmall cell carcinomas and their paired adjacent tissues. We demonstrate a significant reduction of the methylation levels of both elements (p = 7.7 x 10(-14) and 9.6 x 10(-7), respectively). The methylation indices of the 2 elements correlated (p = 0.006), suggesting a possible common mechanism for their methylation maintenance. Genomic instability was measured utilizing 11 fluorescent microsatellite markers located on lung cancer hot-spot regions such as 3p, 5q 9p, 13q and 17p. Hypomethylation of both transposable elements was associated with increased genomic instability (LINE, p = 7.1 x 10(-5); Alu, p = 0.008). The reduction of the methylation index of LINE-1 and Alu following treatment of 3 lung cell lines with 5-aza-2’-deoxycitidine, consistently resulted in increased expression of both elements. Our study demonstrates the strong link between hypomethylation of transposable elements with genomic instability in non-small cell lung cancer and provides early evidence for a potential active role of these elements in lung neoplasia. As demethylating agents are now entering lung cancer trials, it is imperative to gain a greater insight into the potential reactivation of silent retrotransposons in order to advance for the clinical utilization of epigenetics in cancer therapy.},

  abstractnote = {Alu elements have amplified in primate genomes through a RNA-dependent mechanism, termed retroposition, and have reached a copy number in excess of 500,000 copies per human genome. These elements have been proposed to have a number of functions in the human genome, and have certainly had a major impact on genomic architecture. Alu elements continue to amplify at a rate of about one insertion every 200 new births. We have found 16 examples of diseases caused by the insertion of Alu elements, suggesting that they may contribute to about 0.1% of human genetic disorders by this mechanism. The large number of Alu elements within primate genomes also provides abundant opportunities for unequal homologous recombination events. These events often occur intrachromosomally, resulting in deletion or duplication of exons in a gene, but they also can occur interchromosomally, causing more complex chromosomal abnormalities. We have found 33 cases of germ-line genetic diseases and 16 cases of cancer caused by unequal homologous recombination between Alu repeats. We estimate that this mode of mutagenesis accounts for another 0.3% of human genetic diseases. Between these different mechanisms, Alu elements have not only contributed a great deal to the evolution of the genome but also continue to contribute to a significant portion of human genetic diseases.},

ERV long terminal repeats (LTRs) contain strong promoters that are known to contribute to the transcriptional regulation of certain human genes. While some LTRs are known to possess bidirectional promoter activity in vitro, only sense orientation LTR promoters have previously been shown to regulate human gene expression. Here we demonstrate that an ERV1 LTR acts as a bidirectional promoter for the human Down syndrome critical region 4 (DSCR4) and DSCR8 genes. We show that while DSCR4 and DSCR8 are essentially co-expressed, their shared LTR promoter is more active in the sense than the antisense orientation. Through deletion analysis of the LTR we have identified positive and negative regulatory elements, and defined a core region of the promoter that is required for transcriptional activity in both orientations. Finally, we show that the ERV LTR also exists in the genomes of several non-human primates, and present evidence that potential transcription factor binding sites in the core region have been maintained throughout primate evolution.},

  abstractnote = {DNA hypomethylation was the initial epigenetic abnormality recognized in human tumors. However, for several decades after its independent discovery by two laboratories in 1983, it was often ignored as an unwelcome complication, with almost all of the attention on the hypermethylation of promoters of genes that are silenced in cancers (e.g., tumor-suppressor genes). Because it was subsequently shown that global hypomethylation of DNA in cancer was most closely associated with repeated DNA elements, cancer linked-DNA hypomethylation continued to receive rather little attention. DNA hypomethylation in cancer can no longer be considered an oddity, because recent high-resolution genome-wide studies confirm that DNA hypomethylation is the almost constant companion to hypermethylation of the genome in cancer, just usually (but not always) in different sequences. Methylation changes at individual CpG dyads in cancer can have a high degree of dependence not only on the regional context, but also on neighboring sites. DNA demethylation during carcinogenesis may involve hemimethylated dyads as intermediates, followed by spreading of the loss of methylation on both strands. In this review, active demethylation of DNA and the relationship of cancer-associated DNA hypomethylation to cancer stem cells are discussed. Evidence is accumulating for the biological significance and clinical relevance of DNA hypomethylation in cancer, and for cancer-linked demethylation and de novo methylation being highly dynamic processes.},

Mutational analyses have shown that coexpression of functional proteins encoded by the two L1-specific open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, is an essential prerequisite for the propagation of L1 elements in the genome. However, all efforts to identify ORF2-encoded proteins have failed so far. Here, applying a novel antibody we report the presence of proteins encoded by ORF2 in a subset of cellular components of human male gonads. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed coexpression of ORF1 and ORF2 in prespermatogonia of fetal testis, in germ cells of adult testis, and in distinct somatic cell types, such as Leydig, Sertoli, and vascular endothelial cells. Coexpression of both proteins in male germ cells is necessary for the observed genomic expansion of the number of L1 elements. Peptide mass fingerprinting analysis of a ∼130-kDa polypeptide isolated from cultured human dermal microvascular endothelial cells led to the identification of ORF2-encoded peptides. An isolated ∼45-kDa polypeptide was shown to derive from nonfunctional copies of ORF2 coding regions. The presence of both ORF1- and ORF2-encoded proteins in vascular endothelial cells and its apparent association with certain stages of differentiation and maturation of blood vessels may have functional relevance for vasculogenesis and/or angiogenesis.},

Transposable elements, through their capacity to quickly generate genetic variation and affect host gene regulation, may have helped to define species-specific trophoblast gene expression programs. Here we assess the contribution of transposable elements to human trophoblast gene expression as enhancers or promoters. Using epigenomic data from primary human trophoblast and trophoblast stem-cell lines, we identified multiple endogenous retrovirus families with regulatory potential that lie close to genes with preferential expression in trophoblast. These largely primate-specific elements are associated with inter-species gene expression differences and are bound by transcription factors with key roles in placental development. Using genetic editing, we demonstrate that several elements act as transcriptional enhancers of important placental genes, such as CSF1R and PSG5. We also identify an LTR10A element that regulates ENG expression, affecting secretion of soluble endoglin, with potential implications for preeclampsia. Our data show that transposons have made important contributions to human trophoblast gene regulation, and suggest that their activity may affect pregnancy outcomes.},

  abstractnote = {Interspersed repetitions called transposable elements (TEs), commonly referred to as mobile elements, make up a significant portion of the genomes of higher animals. TEs contribute in controlling the expression of genes locally and even far away at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, which is one of their significant functional effects on gene function and genome evolution. There are different mechanisms through which TEs control the expression of genes. First, TEs offer cis-regulatory regions in the genome with their inherent regulatory features for their own expression, making them potential factors for controlling the expression of the host genes. Promoter and enhancer elements contain cis-regulatory sites generated from TE, which function as binding sites for a variety of trans-acting factors. Second, a significant portion of miRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to have TEs that encode for regulatory RNAs, revealing the TE origin of these RNAs. Furthermore, it was shown that TE sequences are essential for these RNAs’ regulatory actions, which include binding to the target mRNA. By being a member of cis-regulatory and regulatory RNA sequences, TEs therefore play essential regulatory roles. Additionally, it has been suggested that TE-derived regulatory RNAs and cis-regulatory regions both contribute to the evolutionary novelty of gene regulation. Additionally, these regulatory systems arising from TE frequently have tissue-specific functions. The objective of this review is to discuss TE-mediated gene regulation, with a particular emphasis on the processes, contributions of various TE types, differential roles of various tissue types, based mostly on recent studies on humans.},

  abstractnote = {The ubiquity of mobile elements in mammalian genomes poses considerable challenges for the maintenance of genome integrity. The predisposition of mobile elements towards participation in genomic rearrangements is largely a consequence of their interspersed homologous nature. As tracts of nonallelic sequence homology, they have the potential to interact in a disruptive manner during both meiotic recombination and DNA repair processes, resulting in genomic alterations ranging from deletions and duplications to large-scale chromosomal rearrangements. Although the deleterious effects of transposable element (TE) insertion events have been extensively documented, it is arguably through post-insertion genomic instability that they pose the greatest hazard to their host genomes. Despite the periodic generation of important evolutionary innovations, genomic alterations involving TE sequences are far more frequently neutral or deleterious in nature. The potentially negative consequences of this instability are perhaps best illustrated by the 25 human genetic diseases that are attributable to TE-mediated rearrangements. Some of these rearrangements, such as those involving the MLL locus in leukemia and the LDL receptor in familial hypercholesterolemia, represent recurrent mutations that have independently arisen multiple times in human populations. While TE-instability has been a potent force in shaping eukaryotic genomes and a significant source of genetic disease, much concerning the mechanisms governing the frequency and variety of these events remains to be clarified. Here we survey the current state of knowledge regarding the mechanisms underlying mobile element-based genetic instability in mammals. Compared to simpler eukaryotic systems, mammalian cells appear to have several modifications to their DNA-repair ensemble that allow them to better cope with the large amount of interspersed homology that has been generated by TEs. In addition to the disruptive potential of nonallelic sequence homology, we also consider recent evidence suggesting that the endonuclease products of TEs may also play a key role in instigating mammalian genomic instability.},

Many somatic retrotransposon insertions occur in known cancer genes. We find that high somatic retrotransposition rates in tumors are associated with high rates of genomic rearrangement and somatic mutation. Finally, we developed TranspoSeq-Exome to interrogate an additional 767 tumor samples with hybrid-capture exome data and discovered 35 novel somatic retrotransposon insertions into exonic regions, including an insertion into an exon of the PTEN tumor suppressor gene. The results of this large-scale, comprehensive analysis of retrotransposon movement across tumor types suggest that somatic retrotransposon insertions may represent an important class of structural variation in cancer.},

We have previously reported that mice carrying a hypomorphic allele for the maintenance DNA methyltransferase (Dnmt1(chip/-)) are hypomethylated and develop thymic lymphomas, demonstrating that genomewide DNA hypomethylation can induce tumors. Hypomethylated cells exhibit inherent chromosomal instability, which is revealed in the lymphomas as a consistent trisomy of chromosome 15. We now report another aspect of the molecular basis for tumor development upon DNA hypomethylation. Seven out of 16 hypomethylation-induced lymphomas were found to contain an intracisternal A particle (IAP) somatic insertion in the middle of the Notch1 genomic locus, leading to generation of an oncogenic form of Notch1 in the tumors. This finding suggests that the molecular basis for hypomethylation-induced tumors in this model involves chromosomal instability events accompanied by activation of endogenous retroviral elements. Our findings validate the proposed role of DNA methylation in suppression of transposable elements in mammalian cells and demonstrate the importance of DNA methylation for normal cell function as well as the potential consequences of spontaneously occurring or chemically induced DNA hypomethylation.},

Here we show that callosal projection neurons located in the hemisphere contralateral to primary GBM tumors promote progression and widespread infiltration. Using this platform to examine GBM infiltration, we identified an activity dependent infiltrating population present at the leading edge of mouse and human tumors that is enriched for axon guidance genes. High-throughput, in vivo screening of these genes identified Sema4F as a key regulator of tumorigenesis and activity-dependent progression. Furthermore, Sema4F promotes the activity-dependent infiltrating population and propagates bi-directional signaling with neurons by remodeling tumor adjacent synapses towards brain network hyperactivity. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that subsets of neurons in locations remote to primary GBM promote malignant progression, while revealing new mechanisms of glioma progression that are regulated by neuronal activity.},

  abstractnote = {Objective: To investigate the relationship between the long interspersed nucleotide element-1 (L1/LINE-1) methylation level and the disease-free survival and cancer-specific survival in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). Background: Cancer cells exhibit 2 types of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation alterations: global DNA hypomethylation and site-specific CpG island promoter hypermethylation. Global DNA hypomethylation plays a role in genomic instability and carcinogenesis. DNA methylation in the LINE-1 repetitive element is a good indicator of the global DNA methylation level. Although the LINE-1 methylation level is attracting interest as a useful marker for predicting cancer prognosis, the prognostic significance of LINE-1 hypomethylaiton in ESCC remains unclear. Methods: Using 217 curatively resected ESCC specimens, we quantified the LINE-1 methylation by utilizing the bisulfite pyrosequencing technology. Promoter methylation levels of MGMT and MLH1 were also evaluated by pyrosequencing. Results: ESCC showed significantly lower LINE-1 methylation levels in comparison with matched normal esophageal mucosa (P < 0.0001; N = 50). LINE-1 hypomethylation was significantly associated with disease-free survival [log-rank P = 0.0008; univariate hazard ratio (HR): 2.32, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.38–3.84, P = 0.0017; multivariate HR: 1.81, 95% CI: 1.06–3.05, P = 0.031] and cancer-specific survival (log-rank P = 0.0020; univariate HR: 2.21, 95% CI: 1.33–3.60, P = 0.0026; multivariate HR: 1.87, 95% CI: 1.12–3.08, P = 0.018]. MGMT and MLH1 hypermethylation were not associated with patient prognosis. Conclusions: LINE-1 hypomethylation in ESCC is associated with a shorter survival, thus suggesting that it has potential for use as a prognostic biomarker.},

A regulatory role for TEs has been suggested in embryonal development and diseases such as cancer but systematic investigation of their functions has been limited by their widespread silencing in the genome. Here, we utilize unbiased massively parallel reporter assay data using a whole human genome library to identify TEs with functional enhancer activity in two human cancer types of endodermal lineage, colorectal and liver cancers. We show that the identified TE enhancers are characterized by genomic features associated with active enhancers, such as epigenetic marks and TF binding. Importantly, we identify distinct TE subfamilies that function as tissue-specific enhancers, namely MER11- and LTR12-elements in colon and liver cancers, respectively. These elements are bound by distinct TFs in each cell type, and they have predicted associations to differentially expressed genes. In conclusion, these data demonstrate how different cancer types can utilize distinct TEs as tissue-specific enhancers, paving the way for comprehensive understanding of the role of TEs as bona fide enhancers in the cancer genomes.},

Many of these endogenous retroelements have retained viral characteristics; some also the capacity to replicate and, consequently, the potential to trigger host innate and adaptive immune responses. However, although retroelements are mainly recognized for their pathogenic potential, recent evidence suggests that this “enemy within” may also have beneficial roles in tuning host immune reactivity.

The full-length L1 sequence is 6.1 kilobases, but the majority of L1 elements are truncated at the 5’ end, resulting in a fivefold higher copy number of 3’ sequences. The nucleotide sequence of L1 elements includes an A-rich 3’ end and two long open reading frames (orf-1 and orf-2), the second of which encodes a potential polypeptide having sequence homology with the reverse transcriptases. This structure suggests that L1 elements represent a class of non-viral retrotransposons. A number of L1 complementary DNAs, including a nearly full-length element, have been isolated from an undifferentiated teratocarcinoma cell line. We now report insertions of L1 elements into exon 14 of the factor VIII gene in two of 240 unrelated patients with haemophilia A. Both of these insertions (3.8 and 2.3 kilobases respectively) contain 3’ portions of the L1 sequence, including the poly (A) tract, and create target site duplications of at least 12 and 13 nucleotides of the factor VIII gene. In addition, their 3’-trailer sequences following orf-2 are nearly identical to the consensus sequence of L1 cDNAs (ref. 6). These results indicate that certain L1 sequences in man can be dispersed, presumably by an RNA intermediate, and cause disease by insertional mutation.},

In this review article, we discuss the presumed role of HERVs in carcinogenesis and their promising diagnostic and prognostic implications.

Here, we develop REdiscoverTE, a computational method for quantifying genome-wide TE expression in RNA sequencing data. Using The Cancer Genome Atlas database, we observe increased expression of over 400 TE subfamilies, of which 262 appear to result from a proximal loss of DNA methylation. The most recurrent TEs are among the evolutionarily youngest in the genome, predominantly expressed from intergenic loci, and associated with antiviral or DNA damage responses. Treatment of glioblastoma cells with a demethylation agent results in both increased TE expression and de novo presentation of TE-derived peptides on MHC class I molecules. Therapeutic reactivation of tumor-specific TEs may synergize with immunotherapy by inducing inflammation and the display of potentially immunogenic neoantigens.},

  abstractnote = {Transposable elements (TEs) are conventionally identified in eukaryotic genomes by alignment to consensus element sequences. Using this approach, about half of the human genome has been previously identified as TEs and low-complexity repeats. We recently developed a highly sensitive alternative de novo strategy, P-clouds, that instead searches for clusters of high-abundance oligonucleotides that are related in sequence space (oligo “clouds”). We show here that P-clouds predicts >840 Mbp of additional repetitive sequences in the human genome, thus suggesting that 66%–69% of the human genome is repetitive or repeat-derived. To investigate this remarkable difference, we conducted detailed analyses of the ability of both P-clouds and a commonly used conventional approach, RepeatMasker (RM), to detect different sized fragments of the highly abundant human Alu and MIR SINEs. RM can have surprisingly low sensitivity for even moderately long fragments, in contrast to P-clouds, which has good sensitivity down to small fragment sizes (∼25 bp). Although short fragments have a high intrinsic probability of being false positives, we performed a probabilistic annotation that reflects this fact. We further developed “element-specific” P-clouds (ESPs) to identify novel Alu and MIR SINE elements, and using it we identified ∼100 Mb of previously unannotated human elements. ESP estimates of new MIR sequences are in good agreement with RM-based predictions of the amount that RM missed. These results highlight the need for combined, probabilistic genome annotation approaches and suggest that the human genome consists of substantially more repetitive sequence than previously believed.},

Previous research has demonstrated bidirectional interactions between neurons and glioma cells, with neuronal activity driving glioma growth1–4 and gliomas increasing neuronal excitability2,5–8. Here we sought to determine how glioma-induced neuronal changes influence neural circuits underlying cognition and whether these interactions influence patient survival. Using intracranial brain recordings during lexical retrieval language tasks in awake humans together with site-specific tumour tissue biopsies and cell biology experiments, we find that gliomas remodel functional neural circuitry such that task-relevant neural responses activate tumour-infiltrated cortex well beyond the cortical regions that are normally recruited in the healthy brain. Site-directed biopsies from regions within the tumour that exhibit high functional connectivity between the tumour and the rest of the brain are enriched for a glioblastoma subpopulation that exhibits a distinct synaptogenic and neuronotrophic phenotype. Tumour cells from functionally connected regions secrete the synaptogenic factor thrombospondin-1, which contributes to the differential neuron–glioma interactions observed in functionally connected tumour regions compared with tumour regions with less functional connectivity. Pharmacological inhibition of thrombospondin-1 using the FDA-approved drug gabapentin decreases glioblastoma proliferation. The degree of functional connectivity between glioblastoma and the normal brain negatively affects both patient survival and performance in language tasks. These data demonstrate that high-grade gliomas functionally remodel neural circuits in the human brain, which both promotes tumour progression and impairs cognition.},

The phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)/phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT)/mTOR pathway has emerged as a crucial player in GBM development and progression. However, to date, all the attempts to target this pathway with PI3K, AKT, or mTORC1 inhibitors failed to improve the outcome of patients with GBM. Despite these discouraging results, recent evidence pointed out that the blockade of mTORC2 might provide a useful therapeutic strategy for GBM, with the potential to overcome the limitations that mTORC1 inhibitors have shown so far. In this review, we analyzed the rationale of targeting mTOR in GBM and the available preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the choice of this therapeutic approach, highlighting the different roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in GBM biology.},

Retroelement transcripts can form double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) that activates the MDA5 pattern recognition receptor1-6. This state of viral mimicry leads to loss of cancer cell fitness and stimulates innate and adaptive immune responses7,8. However, the clinical efficacy of epigenetic therapies has been limited. To find targets that would synergize with the viral mimicry response, we sought to identify the immunogenic retroelements that are activated by epigenetic therapies. Here we show that intronic and intergenic SINE elements, specifically inverted-repeat Alus, are the major source of drug-induced immunogenic dsRNA. These inverted-repeat Alus are frequently located downstream of “orphan” CpG islands9. In mammals, the ADAR1 enzyme targets and destabilizes inverted-repeat Alu dsRNA10, which prevents activation of the MDA5 receptor11. We found that ADAR1 establishes a negative-feedback loop, restricting the viral mimicry response to epigenetic therapy. Depletion of ADAR1 in patient-derived cancer cells potentiates the efficacy of epigenetic therapy, restraining tumour growth and reducing cancer initiation. Therefore, epigenetic therapies trigger viral mimicry by inducing a subset of inverted-repeats Alus, leading to an ADAR1 dependency. Our findings suggest that combining epigenetic therapies with ADAR1 inhibitors represents a promising strategy for cancer treatment.},

  abstractnote = {Long interspersed elements (LINE-1s) are abundant retrotransposons in mammalian genomes that probably retrotranspose by target site-primed reverse transcription (TPRT). During TPRT, the LINE-1 endonuclease cleaves genomic DNA, freeing a 3’ hydroxyl that serves as a primer for reverse transcription of LINE-1 RNA by LINE-1 reverse transcriptase. The nascent LINE-1 cDNA joins to genomic DNA, generating LINE-1 structural hallmarks such as frequent 5’ truncations, a 3’ poly(A)+ tail and variable-length target site duplications (TSDs). Here we describe a pathway for LINE-1 retrotransposition in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that acts independently of endonuclease but is dependent upon reverse transcriptase. We show that endonuclease-independent LINE-1 retrotransposition occurs at near-wildtype levels in two mutant cell lines that are deficient in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ). Analysis of the pre- and post-integration sites revealed that endonuclease-independent retrotransposition results in unusual structures because the LINE-1s integrate at atypical target sequences, are truncated predominantly at their 3’ ends and lack TSDs. Moreover, two of nine endonuclease-independent retrotranspositions contained cDNA fragments at their 3’ ends that are probably derived from the reverse transcription of endogenous mRNA. Thus, our results suggest that LINE-1s can integrate into DNA lesions, resulting in retrotransposon-mediated DNA repair in mammalian cells.},

  abstractnote = {Glioma is the most common malignant tumor in the central nervous system. Altered long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are playing regulatory roles in physiological and pathogenic processes in cancer. Here, we uncovered a differentially expressed lncRNA called brain cytoplasmic RNA 1 (BCYRN1), and elucidated its function and molecular mechanism in the progression and development of glioma. Three fresh tumor tissues from glioma patients and three normal brain tissues from craniocerebral trauma patients were prepared for high-throughput RNA sequencing. Differential RNA transcripts and BCYRN1 were identified by RT-qPCR in glioma samples and controls. CCK-8, colony formation assays, flow cytometry, TUNEL assays, cell migration assays, wound-healing assays, and xenograft model were established to investigate the biological function of BCYRN1 both in vitro and in vivo. Various bioinformatics analysis, dual-luciferase reporter assays, biotinylated RNA pulldown assays, and rescue experiments were conducted to reveal the underlying mechanisms of competitive endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs). 183 lncRNAs were identified with significant dysregulation in glioma and randomly selected differential RNAs were further confirmed by RT-qPCR. Among them, BCYRN1 was the most downregulated lncRNA, and its low expression positively correlated with glioma progression. Functionally, BCYRN1 overexpression inhibited cell proliferation, migration in glioma cell lines, whereas BCYRN1 depletion resulted in the opposite way. MiR-619-5p was further confirmed as the direct target of BCYRN1. Mechanistically, miR-619-5p specifically targeted the CUE domain containing protein 2 (CUEDC2), and BCYRN1/miR-619-5p suppressed glioma tumorigenesis by inactivating PTEN/AKT/p21 pathway in a CUEDC2-dependent manner. Overall, our data presented that the reduced expression of BCYRN1 was associated with poor patient outcome in glioma. BCYRN1 functioned as a ceRNA to inhibit glioma progression by sponging miR-619-5p to regulate CUEDC2 expression and PTEN/AKT/p21 pathway. Our results indicated that BCYRN1 exerted tumor suppressor potential and might be a candidate in the diagnosis and treatment of glioma.},

They are thought to operate as modulators of local protein synthesis in postsynaptic dendritic microdomains, in a capacity in which they would contribute to the maintenance of long-term synaptic plasticity. Because plasticity failure has been proposed to be a starting point for the neurodegenerative changes that are seen in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), we asked whether somatodendritic levels of human BC200 RNA are deregulated in AD brains. We found that in normal aging, BC200 levels in cortical areas were reduced by >60% between the ages of 49 and 86. In contrast, BC200 RNA was significantly up-regulated in AD brains, in comparison with age-matched normal brains. This up-regulation in AD was specific to brain areas that are involved in the disease. Relative BC200 levels in those areas increased in parallel with the progression of AD, as reflected by Clinical Dementia Rating scores. In more advanced stages of the disease, BC200 RNA often assumed a clustered perikaryal localization, indicating that dendritic loss is accompanied by somatic overexpression. Mislocalization and overexpression of BC200 RNA may be reactive–compensatory to, or causative of, synaptodendritic deterioration in AD neurons.},

  abstractnote = {Human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) is distinctive among the retroviruses in the human genome in that many HERV-K proviruses were inserted into the human germline after the human and chimpanzee lineages evolutionarily diverged [1, 2]. However, all full-length endogenous retroviruses described to date in humans are sufficiently old that all humans examined were homozygous for their presence [1]. Moreover, none are intact; all have lethal mutations [1, 3, 4]. Here, we describe the first endogenous retroviruses in humans for which both the full-length provirus and the preintegration site alleles are shown to be present in the human population today. One provirus, called HERV-K113, was present in about 30% of tested individuals, while a second, called HERV-K115, was found in about 15%. HERV-K113 has full-length open reading frames (ORFs) for all viral proteins and lacks any nonsynonymous substitutions in amino acid motifs that are well conserved among retroviruses. This is the first such endogenous retrovirus identified in humans. These findings indicate that HERV-K remained capable of reinfecting humans through very recent evolutionary times and that HERV-K113 is an excellent candidate for an endogenous retrovirus that is capable of reinfecting humans today.},

  abstractnote = {Approximately 8% of the human genome is comprised of endogenous retroviral insertions (ERVs) originating from historic retroviral integration into germ cells. The function of ERVs as regulators of gene expression is well established. Less well studied are insertional polymorphisms of ERVs and their contribution to the heritability of complex phenotypes. The most recent integration of ERV, HERV-K, is expressed in a range of complex human conditions from cancer to neurologic diseases. Using an in-house computational pipeline and whole-genome sequencing data from the diverse 1,000 Genomes Phase 3 population (n = 2,504), we identified 46 polymorphic HERV-K insertions that are tagged by adjacent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). To test the potential role of polymorphic HERV-K in the heritability of complex diseases, existing databases were queried for enrichment of established relationships between the HERV-K insertion-associated SNPs (hiSNPs), and tissue specific gene expression and disease phenotypes. Overall, hiSNPs for the 46 polymorphic HERV-K sites were statistically enriched (p < 1.0E−16) for eQTLs across 44 human tissues. Fifteen of the 46 HERV-K insertions had hiSNPs annotated in the EMBL-EBI GWAS Catalog and cumulatively associated with >100 phenotypes. Experimental factor ontology enrichment analysis suggests that polymorphic HERV-K specifically contribute to neurologic and immunologic disease phenotypes, including traits related to intra cranial volume (FDR 2.00E-09), Parkinson’s disease (FDR 1.80E-09), and autoimmune diseases (FDR 1.80E-09). These results provide strong candidates for context-specific study of polymorphic HERV-K insertions in disease-related traits, serving as a roadmap for future studies of the heritability of complex disease.},

The recently cloned NF1 gene encodes a transcript of 13 kilobases from a ubiquitously expressed locus on chromosome 17 (refs. 2–4). Most NF1 patients are expected to have unique mutations, but only a few have so far been characterized, restricting genetic and functional information and the design of DNA diagnostics. We report an unusual NF1 mutation, that of a de novo Alu repetitive element insertion into an intron, which results in deletion of the downstream exon during splicing and consequently shifts the reading frame. This previously undescribed mechanism of mutation indicates that Alu retrotrans-position is an ongoing process in the human germ line.},

Although many genomic events with direct phenotypic impact have been identified, much of the complex molecular landscape remains incompletely charted for most cancer lineages. For that reason, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network has profiled and analyzed large numbers of human tumours to discover molecular aberrations at the DNA, RNA, protein, and epigenetic levels. The resulting rich data provide a major opportunity to develop an integrated picture of commonalities, differences, and emergent themes across tumour lineages. The Pan-Cancer initiative compares the first twelve tumour types profiled by TCGA. Analysis of the molecular aberrations and their functional roles across tumour types will teach us how to extend therapies effective in one cancer type to others with a similar genomic profile.},

Cancer frequently results from damage to multiple genes controlling cell division and tumor suppressors. It is known that genomic integrity is closely monitored by several surveillance mechanisms, DNA damage checkpoint, DNA repair machinery and mitotic checkpoint. A defect in the regulation of any of these mechanisms often results in genomic instability, which predisposes the cell to malignant transformation. Posttranslational modifications of the histone tails are closely associated with regulation of the cell cycle as well as chromatin structure. Nevertheless, DNA methylation status is also related to genomic integrity. We attempt to summarize recent developments in this field and discuss the debate of driving force of tumor initiation and progression.},

Apart from that subset of genes subject to X inactivation and genomic imprinting, no cellular gene in a non-expressing tissue has been proven to be methylated in a pattern that prevents transcription. It has become increasingly difficult to hold that reversible promoter methylation is commonly involved in developmental gene control; instead, suppression of parasitic sequence elements appears to be the primary function of cytosine methylation, with crucial secondary roles in allele-specific gene expression as seen in X inactivation and genomic imprinting.},

Majority of p53 mutations in cancer are missense mutations, leading to the expression of full-length mutant p53 protein. While the critical role of wild type p53 in tumor suppression has been firmly established, mounting evidence has demonstrated that many tumor-associated mutant p53 proteins not only lose tumor suppressive function of wild type p53, but also gain new activities to promote tumorigenesis independently of wild type p53, termed gain-of-function. Mutant p53 protein often accumulates to very high levels in tumors, contributing to malignant progression. Recently, mutant p53 has become an attractive target for cancer therapy. Further understanding of the mechanisms underlying mutant p53 protein accumulation and gain-of-function will accelerate the development of targeted therapies for human cancer harboring mutant p53. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in the studies on mutant p53 protein accumulation and gain-of-function as well as targeted therapies for mutant p53 in human cancer.,},
